This is a simple Task Manager web application built with Go and htmx, demonstrating the principle of minimal JavaScript in frontend development. It allows you to create, mark tasks as either pending or completed, and delete them.

## Prerequisites

- Docker: Ensure you have Docker installed to easily run this application in a container.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
    cd your-task-manager
    docker build -t task-manager .
    docker run -p 8000:8000 task-manager:latest
```
You can now access the Task Manager in your web browser by opening http://localhost:8000.
